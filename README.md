Description of Project:

This is the first part of an AirBnB clone project where we work on the backend of the project while interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in Python.

The generated data (python objects) are stored in json files and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python


Description of the Command Interpreter:

The app's interface is similar to the Bash shell, except that it accepts a limited number of commands defined solely for use with the Airbnb website.

This command-line interpreter acts as a front-end for a web application, and users can interact with a back-end developed using python OOP programming.

Some available commands are:

exhibit
create
renew
destroy
counting


How to Start it:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing purposes.

When trying to install it, you will need to clone the repo of the project for Github. It will contain the simole shell program and all of its dependecies.


How to Use it:

It can work in two different modes:

Interactive and Non-interactive.
